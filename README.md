# Development Process 
the technical process of making the ideation site.

## Implementation Process

## Highlights 
The highlights of my experience making this project.

- using and implementing the Ai cloud Api components.
  - Azure Open AI.
  - Google Vision CLoud API.
- Designing the front end of the site.
- Creating the image upload system which analyses the image and then posts its data to the backend.
- Creating the community page with the masonry with the MUI library.
- Setting up the profile page and its content switches 
- Setting up the Prompt Constructor for the generation page

## Challenges
The challenges I experience in the development of this project

- Getting the `Ai` `API's` to work properly with the site and getting the right data from them was probaly the `biggest challange`.
- `Parsing` the text data from the `ai` `response` to be more readable for the user.
- Getting the individual post data from when a use `clicks` on a `post`. 

## Bugs to Still Fix
These are the bugs that still persist in the site ðŸª².

- the post image Form input feilds still submit the entry after each input.
- the masonry doesn't resize to the screen unless refreshed.

## future implementations
The Future Plans for The site.

### Deployments
- To One day deploy the site to the internet

### New Features

- to attach the generated ideas to the posted art
- to generate ideas directly off of labels used from posted Ideas 

### Improvements
