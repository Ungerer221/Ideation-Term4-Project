Logo (TM)

# Term Brief
For this Term we were instructed to develop an app or site of our own choosing (i could be whatever we wanted) as long as its main features consist of using an ai api to work. We were allowed to use any code language and framework to develop the site. 
The site also had a to have a positive impact of these fields below.
The Site had to fall into certain categories such as :
- social
- Accessibilty 
- Enviroment
- Health Care

# Development Process 
the technical process of making the ideation site.

## Implementation Process

## Highlights 
The highlights of my experience making this project.

- using and implementing the Ai cloud Api components.
  - Azure Open AI.
  - Google Vision CLoud API.
- Designing the front end of the site.
- Creating the image upload system which analyses the image and then posts its data to the backend.
- Creating the community page with the masonry with the MUI library.
- Setting up the profile page and its content switches 
- Setting up the Prompt Constructor for the generation page

## Challenges
The challenges I experience in the development of this project

- Getting the `Ai` `API's` to work properly with the site and getting the right data from them was probaly the `biggest challange`.
- `Parsing` the text data from the `ai` `response` to be more readable for the user.
- Getting the individual post data from when a use `clicks` on a `post`. 

## User Testing Feedbacküö∂
This is all the feedback from the user testing.

### CS
- Very Cool UI, and likes the look and feel very much.
- would definitly use it and enjoyed using the site.
- To add the ability to post media from the profile page aswell. `(planned)`
- To keep the switch desing consistent.

### Dieter 
- Very nice UI
- very cool idea 
- to add the user's idea that they generated to the post when posting artwork `(planned)`
- to view the post information in the profile page too `(implemented)`
- to format the response from the idea generation to be more readable for the viewer 
- Loading display when generating an idea `(planned)`
- change Profile image and banner `(planned)`

## Bugs to Still Fix
These are the bugs that still persist in the site ü™≤.

- the post image Form input feilds still submit the entry after each input.
- the masonry doesn't resize to the screen unless refreshed.

## future implementations
The Future Plans for The site.

### Deployments
- To One day deploy the site to the internet

### New Features
- To implement Full Profile Customizability (banner Image, Profile Image, Bio, )
- to attach the generated ideas to the posted art - either by posting media through the generated ideas.
- to generate ideas directly off of labels used from posted Ideas 
- To paginate the Community page

### Improvements 
- Improve post interaction and post to user data sharing.
- To improve the Data dsiplayed on a post 
- To improve the display of the user generated idea
- To imporve the Responsiveness of the site 
- improved authentication handeling in login and signup
